# Archive Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the business workflows that define the complete capstone lifecycle implemented in **Archive**. Each document focuses on a specific business process and describes the actors, preconditions, workflow, postconditions, alternate flows, business rules, and expected outcomes.

The workflows are organized according to the chronological flow of a capstone project, beginning with coordinator assignment and ending with progress monitoring.

# Supporting Documents

The following documents complement the workflow documentation and define system-wide behavior.

* Notification Rules — `../notification-rules.md`
* Business Rules — `../business-rules.md`
* User Roles — `../user-roles.md`
* Project Overview — `../project-overview.md`

# Notes

* These workflow documents describe the business processes implemented by Archive.
* Each workflow focuses on a single responsibility and may reference other workflows to avoid duplication.
* Common processes, such as the Adviser Review workflow, are documented once and reused across multiple phases of the capstone lifecycle.
* System-wide rules that apply across multiple workflows are documented separately in the supporting documentation.
